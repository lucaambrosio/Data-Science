    "Did you notice that, so far, we considered similar words such as \"car\" vs \"cars\" (or \"launch\" vs \"launched\") as different words? That's probably not ideal.  It would be great if we could reduce all words to a \"simple\" form, so that we count both \"car\" and \"cars\" as the same word.  This operation in the Natural Language Processing literature  is called *stemming* (closely related: *lemmatization*).

      "\n",
      "    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\n",
      "The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\n",

      "the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\n",

      "    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\n",
      "marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\n",
      "into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\n",

      "larger and more forgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\n",
      "felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\n",
      "it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\n",

      "    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\n",

      "The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the\n",
      "Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The\n",
      "day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\n",
      "covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\n",
      "the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\n",
      "assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\n",
      "options and operations concepts also were held.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n",
      "\n",
      "¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\n",
      "said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\n",
      "identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\n",
      "and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\n",
      "to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\n",
      "capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\n",
      "Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\n",
      "systems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\n",

      "Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\n",
      "Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\n",
      "ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\n",
      "docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\n",

      "\n",
      "¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\n",

      "from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\n",
      "Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\n",
      "Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\n",
      "baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\n",
      "system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\n",
      "Management System.\n",

      "Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\n",

      "orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n",
      "\n",

      "propulsion systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\n",
      "state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\n",
      "a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\n",
      "the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\n",
      "would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\n",
      "option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\n",

      "¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\n",
      "the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\n",
      "rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\n",
      "main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\n",
      "and jettisoned after ET separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\n",
      "cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\n",
      "centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\n",

      "In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor\n",
